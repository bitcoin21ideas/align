# Changelog

## v0.2.1 — 2026-04-23

- Fix: GitHub Actions CI — workflow checks use real n8n node types (HTTP Deepgram, LangChain Gemini) and assert `prompts/gemini-main.md` is referenced

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-18

- Add: memory index — `memory/memory-index.md` injected into every Gemini call; one line per entry (`id | type | project | summary | supersedes | affects`)
- Add: n8n nodes — Get memory index (pre-Gemini read), Extract index lines, Has new entries, Update memory index (post-memory-append write)
- Update: Decode node — reads and decodes memory index, passes `memoryIndex` and `memoryIndexSHA` downstream
- Update: Message a model — MEMORY INDEX section injected between date and rolling context
- Update: Gemini prompt — three inputs declared, `supersedes` field added to OUTPUT 4, `status` field removed
- Fix: Get memory — `continueRegularOutput` added; workflow no longer crashes on month boundary when monthly file doesn't exist yet
- Fix: Decode memory — gracefully handles missing content instead of crashing on `Buffer.from(undefined)`
- Update: memory-schema.md — removes `status` field and retraction section; supersession lifecycle now documented via index
- Update: architecture.md — documents three reads and five writes, corrects `notes/` → `walks/` path, corrects Gemini retry claim

## v0.1.4 — 2026-04-18

- Add: docs/competitive-landscape.md — competitor profiles, techniques to steal, memory retrieval approaches
